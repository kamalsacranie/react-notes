## What is React?

React is a library for building UI:

- React runs on the client as a single page application abut can be used to
  build full stack apps by communicating with an API
- React is a frontend framework
- React has a whole bunch of plugins that allow you to do a lote more

## Why use react

React allows the best way to build your UI using different components which
allows for very dynamic HTML within JavaScript. It does this using JSX (which
is extended JS). React uses what is called the Virtual DOM which allows us to
have a more dymic environment etc.

With react, youâ€™ll look at your UI as a bunch of components which you will
write code for.
