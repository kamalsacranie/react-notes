# Styles

## In-line styles

If we are going to add styles inline in one of our React componenets, we can use the fact that JSX allows for HTML/CSS. This is donw within a tag using double curly braces:

```javascript
const Component = () => {
	return (
		<h1 style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', color: 'red' }}>
		</h1>
	)
```

- Note here that we use double curly braces
- We also have CSS elements in camelCase
- Style elements are also seperated by `,` not  `;`

## Via a variable in the same JS file

This is pretty self explanitary. We can just create an object somewhere else in our JS document and add the style inline using the constant keyword that we created.

## Using a CSS file

Using a CSS file is pretty simple, you just relate the link in your `index.html` file.
