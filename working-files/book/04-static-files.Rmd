# Static assets

If we are ready to deploy, we can run `npm run build` which creates a build in
a folder called build. Basically all our react gets converted to vanilla JS
which we can deploy. So basically we would deploy the files in the build
folder.

You can go about deploying your files in many different ways. Anything that
hosts JS, HTML, and CSS static files can host regular react apps. If you have a
database, it becomes a bit harder to host because you need a server to run your
backend.
